<h2><h2 style="text-align:center;">   AN EXCITING NEW SECONDARY STEM PROJECT USING RASPBERRY PI TO CREATE A WEATHER STATION</h2>

<div id='NSt'><p id='NStext'>


<h5>Curriculum Links</h5>
<pre>
The project offers many oppourtunities to link with the curriculum, espicially computing, science, engineering, maths and geography.  
Curriculum links are given in Appendix I.  It also gives valuable experience towards a wide range of careers.  
More information is availiable from:

</ul>

<h5>Weather</h5>
<pre>
Here are some questions to inspire you:
<ul>
	<li>Barometers are traditionally used to predict, wet or changeable weather ahead by measuring air pressure. How reliable is this method?</li>
	<li>How do temperatures vary throughout the ear? How do daylight hours vary throughout the year? Are temperature and daylight related?</li>
	<li>How does wind direction and speed affect temperature? How is wind speed related to air pressure? How is wind direction related to 
temperature?</li>
	<li>How does rainfll throughout the year? What are the good predictors for rain? How does humidity vary throughout the year? Is humidity 
a good predictor for rain? </li>
	<li>Are any of these good predictors of storms? Are any of these good predictors for "good weather"?</li>
</ul> 
And some more general questions:
<ul>
	<li>What are good conditions to generate a rainbow? What are good conditions for a sunrise or sunset?</li>
	<li>How accurate are TV weather forecasts? Does it depend how far ahead the predictions are made? Are some weather conditions easier
to predict than others?</li>
	<li>How do weather conditions relate to other measuremnets: Ice cream sales in a local shop, how often you have to cut the grass, power 
generated by solar cells?</li>
</ul>
